Peter started this journey purely as a means to code more, test out designs stuck in his head, hopefully help others, and **hopefully** find a way to make some passive income.

## `chill-viking` primary objective

1. Create stuff that people like to use and have fun on the adventure

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
